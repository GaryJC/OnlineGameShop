                                FIFA 20 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the 
                                FIFA series. It is the 27th installment in the FIFA series, and was released on 27 
                                September 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. 
                                Real Madrid winger Eden Hazard was named the new cover star of the Regular Edition, with 
                                 defender Virgil van Dijk on the cover of the Champions Edition. Former Juventus and 
                                 Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane was later named as the cover star for the Ultimate 
                                 Edition. The game features VOLTA Football for the first time, a new mode that provides
                                  a variance on the traditional 11v11 gameplay and focuses on small-sided street and futsal 
                                  games. The mode is believed to be focused on the former FIFA Street series.
