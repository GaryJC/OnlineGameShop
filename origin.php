          <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca"><strong>Electronic Arts Inc.</strong></a> (EA) is an American video game
            company headquartered in Redwood City, California.
            It is the second-largest gaming
            company in the Americas and Europe by revenue and market capitalization after Activision Blizzard and ahead
            of Take-Two Interactive
            and Ubisoft as of March 2018. Founded and incorporated on May 27, 1982, by Apple employee Trip Hawkins, the
            company was a pioneer of
            the early home computer games industry and was notable for promoting the designers and programmers
            responsible for its games. EA published
            numerous games and productivity software for personal computers and later experimented on techniques to
            internally develop games, leading
            to the 1987 release of Skate or Die! The company would later decide in favor of abandoning their original
            principles and acquiring
            smaller companies that they see profitable, as well as annually releasing franchises to stay profitable.
