## Project Overview
Our website for this project is called “Gamers!”. As its name has already descried, it is a website mainly served for video game lovers and players. The websites can be separate into three parts: the sign up/ log in part which provide the member’s only function, game filter part which enable user to categorize the game and game detail part which enable the user to view the information of the games and leave comments there.
